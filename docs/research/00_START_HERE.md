## The 30-Second Summary

### Which Search API?
**Use Tavily** ($0.005/search) - AI-optimized for agents

### Which Content Extraction?
**Use Trafilatura** (free) - Best extraction quality (0.883 F1)

### How to Cache?
**Three-layer approach** - In-memory → SQLite → Semantic (saves 90%)

### How Much Will It Cost?
**~$45-100/month** for 10K searches/month with caching

### How Long to Implement?
**1-2 weeks** for MVP (Tavily + SQLite cache)

## Key Findings at a Glance

### 1. Search APIs Ranked by Recommendation

| Rank | API | Cost | When to Use |
|------|-----|------|-----------|
| 🥇 1st | **Tavily** | $0.005/search | AI agents (primary choice) |
| 🥈 2nd | **Brave** | $0.003/search | Cost-sensitive, alternative results |
| 🥉 3rd | **SerpAPI** | $0.015/search | Need multi-engine (Google + Baidu) |
| ⚪ 4th | **DuckDuckGo** | Free | Privacy-first, unreliable |

**Recommendation**: Start with Tavily, add Brave as fallback

### 2. Content Extraction Tools

| Tool | Cost | Quality | Best For |
|------|------|---------|----------|
| **Trafilatura** | Free | 0.883 F1 (best) | Default choice |
| **Playwright** | Free | Varies | JavaScript-heavy pages |
| **Firecrawl** | $0.15-0.32 | Excellent | Complex pages (outsource) |
| **Apify** | $0.20/CU | Good | Marketplace ecosystem |

**Recommendation**: Trafilatura for MVP, Playwright for JS pages, Firecrawl for complex extraction

### 3. Caching Strategy Savings

```
No caching:             $0.005 per search
With 70% cache hit:     $0.0015 per search (-70%)
Plus token optimization: $0.001 per search (-80%)
Plus semantic cache:     $0.0005 per search (-90%)
```

**Recommendation**: Implement all three layers for production

### 4. Cost Projections

**For 10,000 searches/month**:
```
Search API (Tavily):     $50/month
With caching:            $15/month (-70%)
With token optimization: $5/month (-90%)
Infrastructure:          $20/month
Total MVP:               ~$40/month
```

**For 100,000 searches/month**:
```
With semantic caching:   $150/month
With prompt caching:     $50/month (-90% tokens)
Infrastructure:          $50/month
Total production:        ~$250/month
```
