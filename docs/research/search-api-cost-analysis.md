## 1. Search API Detailed Pricing

### Tavily Search API

**Pricing Model**: Credit-based, pay-as-you-go

| Search Type | Cost | Typical Latency | Content Quality |
|------------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Ultra-fast | 1 credit | ~200ms | Good |
| Fast/Basic | 1 credit | ~500ms | Good |
| Advanced | 2 credits | ~1500ms | Excellent |

**Free Tier**:
- 500 searches/month
- Limited to basic depth
- No chunks_per_source

**Paid Tiers**:
- 5,000 searches/month: ~$50/month ($0.010/search)
- 10,000 searches/month: ~$100/month ($0.010/search)
- 100,000 searches/month: ~$500/month ($0.005/search)

**Cost Optimization Features**:
- `include_answer: true` offloads summarization (saves agent tokens)
- `chunks_per_source: 2` limits content (reduces token injection)
- `auto_parameters: true` uses cheapest effective depth
- Markdown output = 60% smaller than HTML
- **Est. token savings**: 70-80% vs. raw web scraping

**Real-World Cost Example** (10,000 monthly agent interactions):
```
Base searches:           10,000 × $0.005/search = $50/month
With caching (70% hit):  3,000  × $0.005/search = $15/month
Context reduction:       2KB → 600B per search  = 70% fewer tokens
Monthly cost:            ~$15-20
Cost per interaction:    $0.0015-0.002 (with caching + token reduction)
```

---

### Scenario 3: Large-Scale Project (100,000 searches/month)

| Tool | Search | Content | Caching | LLM Tokens | Total | Per Request |
|------|--------|---------|---------|-----------|-------|------------|
| **Tavily** | $500 | - | $0 | $200 | $700 | $0.007 |

## 4. Hidden Costs & Cost Multipliers

### Rate Limiting & Overage Fees

| API | Rate Limit | Overage Cost |
|-----|-----------|--------------|
| Tavily | Unlimited | 2 credits per search |
| Brave | Per-plan | Same as plan rate |
| SerpAPI | 5,000/day free | $0.015/search |
| Google Search | 5,000/day | $0.05/query |
| Firecrawl | Per credit | $0.32-0.15 per page |

**Mitigation**: Implement exponential backoff and caching

### Token Cost Hidden Multiplier

Search results consume tokens when injected into context:

```
Raw HTML → LLM tokens: 1 page = ~2,000 tokens
Markdown → LLM tokens: 1 page = ~600 tokens (70% reduction!)
Summarized → LLM tokens: 1 page = ~100 tokens (95% reduction!)

Claude 3.5 Sonnet costs:
- Input: $3/1M tokens
- Output: $15/1M tokens

Injecting 5 HTML pages:
  10,000 tokens × $3/1M = $0.03 per search

Injecting 5 Markdown pages:
  3,000 tokens × $3/1M = $0.009 per search

Using Tavily include_answer (offloads summarization):
  500 tokens × $3/1M = $0.0015 per search

Effective cost: Search + Tokens + Caching
```

### JavaScript Rendering Multiplier

| Provider | Base | JS Enabled | Multiplier |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| Firecrawl | 1 credit | Included | 1x |
| Apify | 5 CUs | Standard | 1x |
| ScrapingBee | 1 credit | 5 credits | 5x |
| BrightData | Variable | 2-10x | 2-10x |

---

## 5. Token Saving Strategies (Hidden Savings)

### Strategy 1: Markdown Output
```
HTML size:      15,000 bytes → 3,000 tokens
Markdown size:  5,000 bytes → 600 tokens
Savings:        80% fewer tokens

Cost impact: 5 searches/day × 30 days × 2,400 tokens saved
            = 360,000 token savings × $0.003 = $1.08/month per agent
            For 100 agents: $108/month = 19% total cost reduction
```

### Strategy 2: Include Answer (Tavily)
```
Agent needs to summarize 5 results:
- Without: 5 searches × 3K tokens = 15,000 tokens to summarize
- With Tavily answer: 1 search × 1K tokens = 1,000 tokens
- Cost: 1 Tavily credit ($0.005-0.012) vs. 14,000 tokens ($0.042)
- Savings: 85% on summarization cost
```

### Strategy 3: Semantic Caching
```
100 daily searches with 70% semantic cache hit rate:
- Searches executed: 30/day × $0.005 = $0.15/day
- Searches cached: 70/day × $0 = $0
- Daily savings: $0.35/day = $10.50/month
- Yearly savings: $126

For 100 concurrent agents:
- Monthly: $10,500
- Yearly: $126,000
```

### Strategy 4: Prompt Caching
Assuming Claude 3.5 Sonnet and system prompt reuse:

```
System prompt (8,000 tokens):
- With caching: 8,000 × $3/1M × 0.1 = $0.0024 per request
- Without: 8,000 × $3/1M = $0.024 per request
- Per-request savings: $0.0216 (90% reduction!)

For 10,000 daily requests:
- Daily savings: 10,000 × $0.0216 = $216
- Monthly savings: $6,480
- Yearly savings: $77,760
```

## 6. Recommended Cost-Optimized Architecture

### Tier 1: MVP (Under $100/month)

**Services**:
- Brave Search (Free tier)
- Trafilatura (self-hosted, free)
- SQLite caching (local)

**Costs**: $0-30/month
**Limitation**: < 2,000 searches/month

### Tier 2: Growth (Under $500/month)

**Services**:
- Tavily Search (primary)
- Firecrawl (content extraction for complex pages)
- Redis caching (distributed)
- Prompt caching (Anthropic)

**Stack**:
```
Query → Semantic cache hit? → Use cached result
         ↓ (no)
         → Tavily search ($0.005)
         → Parse Markdown + Prompt cache ($0.0015)
         → Return result ($0.0065/query)

With caching (70% hit): $0.002/query effective cost
```

**Costs**: $50-150/month (Tavily) + $50 (Redis)
**Capacity**: 10,000 searches/month

### Tier 3: Production (Predictable Scaling)

**Services**:
- Tavily (primary search)
- Brave (fallback for diversity)
- Firecrawl (complex extraction)
- Redis + SQLite (multi-layer caching)
- Prompt caching + Token optimization
- Semantic cache (embeddings-based)

**Cost Formula**:
```
Cost = (searches × provider_cost)
     - (searches × cache_hit_rate × provider_cost)
     + (content_extraction × firecrawl_cost)
     + (infrastructure × 50)

Example (100K searches/month):
= (100,000 × $0.005)
- (100,000 × 0.70 × $0.005)
+ (10,000 × $0.15)
+ $50
= $500 - $350 + $1,500 + $50
= $1,700/month
```

**Capacity**: 100,000+ searches/month
**Cost per search**: $0.017 (including extraction + infrastructure)
